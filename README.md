The idea is to make a perfume suggestion app based on perfumes you like and other people like.

Tell us how you plan on bringing it to life. 
I’m working on dummy flutter application and would make it as a service where google cloud and firebase as my backend but I’m failing on getting access to data so I scraped my own from a website. With Google’s help I need images and other information regarding a perfume like barcode base notes middle notes and top notes….etc. which I listed in a google spread sheet.
